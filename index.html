		Reconfiguration problems require finding a step-by-step transformation between a pair of feasible solutions for a particular problem.
		The primary concern in Theoretical Computer Science has been revealing their computational complexity for classical problems.

		This paper presents an initial study on reconfiguration problems derived from a submodular function, which has more of a flavor of Data Mining.
		Our submodular reconfiguration problems request to find a solution sequence connecting two input solutions such that each solution has an objective value above a threshold in a submodular function $f: 2^{[n]} \to \mathbb{R}_+$ and is obtained from the previous one by applying a simple transformation rule.
		We formulate three reconfiguration problems:
		Monotone Submodular Reconfiguration (MSReco), which applies to influence maximization, and two versions of Unconstrained Submodular Reconfiguration (USReco), which apply to determinantal point processes.
		Our contributions are summarized as follows:
		<ul>
		<li>
		We prove that MSReco and USReco are both $\textbf{PSPACE}$-complete.
		</li>
		<li>
		We design a $\frac{1}{2}$-approximation algorithm for MSReco and a $\frac{1}{n}$-approximation algorithm for (one version of) USReco.
		</li>
		<li>
		We devise inapproximability results that approximating the optimum value of MSReco within a $(1-\frac{1+\epsilon}{n^2})$-factor is $\textbf{PSPACE}$-hard, and we cannot find a $(\frac{5}{6}+\epsilon)$-approximation for USReco.
		</li>
		<li>
		We conduct numerical study on the reconfiguration version of influence maximization and determinantal point processes using real-world social network and movie rating data.

		Determinantal point processes (DPPs) are attractive probabilistic models for expressing item quality and set diversity simultaneously.
		Although DPPs are widely-applicable to many subset selection tasks, there exist simple small-size probability distributions that any DPP cannot express.
		To overcome this drawback while keeping good properties of DPPs, in this paper we investigate the expressive power of convex combinations of DPPs.
		We provide upper and lower bounds for the number of DPPs required for exactly expressing any probability distribution.
		For the approximation error, we give an upper bound on the Kullback--Leibler divergence $n-\lfloor \log t\rfloor +\epsilon$ for any $\epsilon >0$ of approximate distribution from a given joint probability distribution, where $t$ is the number of DPPs.
		Our numerical simulation on an online retail dataset empirically verifies that a convex combination of only two DPPs can outperform a nonsymmetric DPP in terms of the Kullback--Leibler divergence.
		By combining a polynomial number of DPPs, we can express probability distributions induced by bounded-degree pseudo-Boolean functions, which include weighted coverage functions of bounded occurrence.

		The concept of k-submodularity is an extension of submodularity, of which maximization has various applications, such as influence maximization and sensor placement.
		In such situations, to model complicated real problems, we want to deal with multiple factors, such as, more detailed parameter representing a property of a given function or a constraint which should be imposed for a given function, simultaneously.
		Besides, it is preferable that an algorithm for the modeling problem is simple. In this paper, for both monotone k-submodular function maximization with bounded curvature and monotone weakly k-submodular function maximization, we give approximation ratio analysis on greedy-type algorithms on the problem with the matroid constraint and that with the individual size constraint.
		Furthermore, we give an approximation ratio analysis on another type of the relaxation of k-submodular functions, approximately k-submodular functions, with the matroid constraint.

		We study a new optimization problem called submodular maximization under submodular cover (SMSC), which requires to find a fixed-size set such that one monotone submodular function $f$ is maximized subject to that another monotone submodular function $g$ is maximized approximately.
		SMSC is preferable to submodular function maximization when one wants to maximize two objective functions simultaneously.
		We propose an optimization framework for SMSC, which guarantees a constant-factor approximation.
		Our algorithm's key idea is to construct a new instance of submodular function maximization from a given instance of SMSC, which can be approximated efficiently.
		Besides, if we are given an approximation oracle for submodular function maximization, our algorithm provably produces nearly optimal solutions.
		We experimentally evaluate the proposed algorithm in terms of sensor placement and movie recommendation using real-world data.

		We consider the problem of counting the number of vertices reachable from each vertex in a digraph $G$, which is equal to computing all the out-degrees of the transitive closure of $G$.
		The current (theoretically) fastest algorithms run in quadratic time; however, Borassi has shown that this problem is not solvable in truly subquadratic time unless the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis fails [Inf. Process. Lett., 116(10):628--630, 2016].
		In this paper, we present an $\mathcal{O}(f^3n)$-time exact algorithm, where $n$ is the number of vertices in $G$ and $f$ is the feedback edge number of $G$.
		Our algorithm thus runs in truly subquadratic time for digraphs of $f=\mathcal{O}(n^{\frac{1}{3}-\epsilon})$ for any $\epsilon > 0$, i.e., the number of edges is $n$ plus $\mathcal{O}(n^{\frac{1}{3}-\epsilon})$, and is fully polynomial fixed parameter tractable, the notion of which was first introduced by  Fomin, Lokshtanov, Pilipczuk, Saurabh, and Wrochna [ACM Trans. Algorithms, 14(3):34:1--34:45, 2018].
		We also show that the same result holds for vertex-weighted digraphs, where the task is to compute the total weights of vertices reachable from each vertex.

		 In this paper, we propose algorithms for online submodular optimization with tracking regret bounds. Online submodular optimization is a generic framework for sequential decision making used to select subsets. Existing algorithms for online submodular optimization have been shown to achieve small (static) regret, which means that the algorithm’s performance is comparable to the performance of a fixed optimal action. Such algorithms, however, may perform poorly in an environment that changes over time. To overcome this problem, we apply a tracking-regret-analysis framework to online submodular optimization, one by which output is assessed through comparison with time-varying optimal subsets. We propose algorithms for submodular minimization, monotone submodular maximization under a size constraint, and unconstrained submodular maximization, and we show tracking regret bounds. In addition, we show that our tracking regret bound for submodular minimization is nearly tight.

		Prediction in a new domain without any training sample, called zero-shot domain adaptation (ZSDA), is an important task in domain adaptation.
		While prediction in a new domain has gained much attention in recent years, in this paper, we investigate another potential of ZSDA.

		The task is regarded as predictive optimization, but existing predictive optimization methods have not been extended to handling multiple domains.
		We propose a simple framework for predictive optimization with ZSDA and analyze the condition in which the optimization problem becomes convex optimization.
		We also discuss how to handle the interaction of characteristics of a domain in predictive optimization.

		We consider the product of determinantal point processes (DPPs), a point process whose probability mass is proportional to the product of principal minors of multiple matrices as a natural, promising generalization of DPPs.
		We study the computational complexity of computing its normalizing constant, which is among the most essential probabilistic inference tasks.
		Our complexity-theoretic results (almost) rule out the existence of efficient algorithms for this task, unless input matrices are forced to have favorable structures.
		In particular, we prove the following:
		<ul>
		<li>
		Computing $ \sum_{S} \det(\mathbf{A}_{S,S})^p $ exactly for every (fixed) positive even integer $p$ is $\textsf{UP}$-hard and $\textsf{Mod}_3\textsf{P}$-hard,

		is $\textsf{NP}$-hard to approximate within a factor of $ 2^{\mathcal{O}(|\mathcal{I}|^{1-\epsilon})} $ for any $\epsilon > 0$, where $|\mathcal{I}|$ is the input size.

		Influence maximization is among the most fundamental algorithmic problems in social influence analysis.
		Over the last decade, a great effort has been devoted to developing efficient algorithms for influence maximization, so that identifying the ``best'' algorithm has become a demanding task.
		In SIGMOD'17, Arora, Galhotra, and Ranu reported benchmark results on eleven existing algorithms and demonstrated that there is no single state-of-the-art offering the best trade-off between computational efficiency and solution quality.
		<br/>
		In this paper, we report a high-level experimental study on three well-established algorithmic approaches for influence maximization, referred to as Oneshot, Snapshot, and Reverse Influence Sampling (RIS).
		Different from Arora et al., our experimental methodology is so designed that we examine the distribution of random solutions, characterize the relation between the sample number and the actual solution quality, and avoid implementation dependencies.
		Our main findings are as follows:
		1. For a sufficiently large sample number, we obtain a unique solution regardless of algorithms.
		2. The average solution quality of Oneshot, Snapshot, and RIS improves at the same rate up to scaling of sample number.
		3. Oneshot requires more samples than Snapshot, and Snapshot requires fewer but larger samples than RIS.
		We discuss the time efficiency when conditioning Oneshot, Snapshot, and RIS to be of identical accuracy.
 		Our conclusion is that Oneshot is suitable only if the size of available memory is limited, and RIS is more efficient than Snapshot for large networks; Snapshot is preferable for small, low-probability networks.

		In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical predictive optimization pipeline that is able to deal with a wide range of applications including inventory management.
		Based on an existing hierarchical demand prediction model, we present a stochastic matching framework that can manage prediction-uncertainty in decision making.

		We consider and formulate problems of PageRank score boosting motivated by applications such as effective web advertising.
		More precisely, given a graph and target vertices, one is required to find a fixed-size set of missing edges that maximizes the minimum PageRank score among the targets.
		We provide theoretical analyses to show that all of them are NP-hard.
		To overcome the hardness, we develop heuristic-based algorithms for them.
		We finally perform experiments on several real-world networks to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms compared to baselines.
		Specifically, our algorithm achieves 100 times improvements of the minimum PageRank score among selected 100 vertices by adding only dozens of edges.

		Algorithmic problems of computing influence estimation and influence

		There are many classical problems in P whose time complexities have not been improved over the past decades.
		Recent studies of ``Hardness in P'' have revealed that, for several of such problems, the current fastest algorithm is the best possible under some complexity assumptions.
		To bypass this difficulty, Fomin et al. (SODA 2017) introduced the concept of fully polynomial FPT algorithms.
		For a problem with the current best time complexity $$O(n^c)$$, the goal is to design an algorithm running in $$k^{O(1)}n^{c'}$$ time for a parameter $$k$$ and a constant $$c' < c$$. <br>
		In this paper, we investigate the complexity of graph problems in P parameterized by tree-depth, a graph parameter related to tree-width.
		We show that a simple divide-and-conquer method can solve many graph problems, including
		Weighted Matching, Negative Cycle Detection, Minimum Weight Cycle, Replacement Paths, and 2-hop Cover,
		in $$O(\mathrm{td}\cdot m)$$ time or $$O(\mathrm{td}\cdot (m+n\log n))$$ time, where $$\mathrm{td}$$ is the tree-depth of the input graph.
		Because any graph of tree-width $$\mathrm{tw}$$ has tree-depth at most $$(\mathrm{tw}+1)\log_2 n$$, our algorithms also run in $$O(\mathrm{tw}\cdot m\log n)$$ time or $$O(\mathrm{tw}\cdot (m+n\log n)\log n)$$ time.
		These results match or improve the previous best algorithms parameterized by tree-width.
		Especially, we solve an open problem of fully polynomial FPT algorithm for Weighted Matching parameterized by tree-width posed by Fomin et al.

			Fueled by the increasing popularity of online social networks, social influence analysis has attracted a great deal of research attention in the past decade.
			The diffusion process is often modeled using influence graphs, and there has been a line of research that involves algorithmic problems in influence graphs.
			However, the vast size of today's real-world networks raises a serious issue with regard to computational efficiency.<br/>

			In this paper, we propose a new algorithm for reducing influence graphs.
			Given an input influence graph, the proposed algorithm produces a vertex-weighted influence graph, which is compact and approximates the diffusion properties of the input graph.
			The central strategy of influence graph reduction is coarsening, which has the potential to greatly reduce the number of edges by merging a vertex set into a single weighted vertex.
			We provide two implementations; a speed-oriented implementation which runs in linear time with linear space and a scalability-oriented implementation which runs in practically linear time with sublinear space.
			Further, we present general frameworks using our compact graphs that accelerate existing algorithms for influence maximization and influence estimation problems, which are motivated by practical applications, such as viral marketing.
			Using these frameworks, we can quickly obtain solutions that have accuracy guarantees under a reasonable assumption.
			Experiments with real-world networks demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can scale to billion-edge graphs and reduce the graph size to up to 4%.
			In addition, our influence maximization framework achieves four times speed-up of a state-of-the-art D-SSA algorithm, and
			our influence estimation framework cuts down the computation time of a simulation-based method to 3.5%.

			Motivated by viral marketing, stochastic diffusion processes that model influence spread on a network have been studied intensively. The primary interest in such models has been to find a seed set of a fixed size that maximizes the expected size of the cascade from it. Practically, however, it is not desirable to have the risk of ending with a small cascade, even if the expected size of the cascade is large. To address this issue, we adopt conditional value at risk (CVaR) as a risk measure, and propose an algorithm that computes a portfolio over seed sets with a provable guarantee on its CVaR. Using real-world social networks, we demonstrate that the portfolio computed by our algorithm has a significantly better CVaR than seed sets computed by other baseline methods.

		We consider the product of determinantal point processes (DPPs), a point process whose probability mass is proportional to the product of principal minors of multiple matrices, as a natural, promising generalization of DPPs.
		We study the computational complexity of computing its normalizing constant, which is among the most essential probabilistic inference tasks.
		Our complexity-theoretic results (almost) rule out the existence of efficient algorithms for this task unless the input matrices are forced to have favorable structures.
		In particular, we prove the following:
		<ul>
		<li>
		Computing $\sum_S\det(\mathbf{A}_{S,S})^p$ exactly for every (fixed) positive even integer $p$ is $\textsf{UP}$-hard and $\textsf{Mod}_3\textsf{P}$-hard, which gives a negative answer to an open question posed by Kulesza and Taskar (2012).
		</li>
		<li>
		$\sum_S\det(\mathbf{A}_{S,S})\det(\mathbf{B}_{S,S})\det(\mathbf{C}_{S,S})$ is $\textsf{NP}$-hard to approximate within a factor of $2^{O(|\mathcal{I}|^{1-\epsilon})}$ or $2^{\mathcal{O}(n^{1/\epsilon})}$ for any $\epsilon>0$, where $|\mathcal{I}|$ is the input size and $n$ is the order of the input matrix.
		This result is stronger than the #P-hardness for the case of two matrices derived by Gillenwater (2014).
		</li>
		<li>
		There exists a $k^{\mathcal{O}(k)}n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$-time algorithm for computing $\sum_S\det(\mathbf{A}_{S,S})\det(\mathbf{B}_{S,S})$, where $k$ is the maximum rank of $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ or the treewidth of the graph formed by nonzero entries of $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$. Such parameterized algorithms are said to be fixed-parameter tractable.
		</li>
		</ul>
		These results can be extended to the fixed-size case.
		Further, we present two applications of fixed-parameter tractable algorithms given a matrix $\mathbf{A}$ of treewidth $w$:
		<ul>
		<li>
		We can compute a $2^{\frac{n}{2p-1}}$-approximation to $\sum_S\det({\bf A}_{S,S})^p$ for any fractional number $p>1$ in $w^{\mathcal{O}(wp)}n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$ time.
		</li>
		<li>
		We can find a $2^{\sqrt n}$-approximation to unconstrained maximum a posteriori inference in $w^{\mathcal{O}(w\sqrt n)}n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$ time.

		We study the problem of deciding reconfigurability of target sets of a graph.
		Given a graph $G$ with vertex thresholds $\tau$, consider a dynamic process in which vertex $v$ becomes activated once at least $\tau(v)$ of its neighbors are activated.
		A vertex set $S$ is called a target set if all vertices of $G$ would be activated when initially activating vertices of $S$.
		In the Target Set Reconfiguration problem, given two target sets $X$ and $Y$ of the same size, we are required to determine whether $X$ can be transformed into $Y$ by repeatedly swapping one vertex in the current set with another vertex not in the current set preserving every intermediate set as a target set.
		In this paper, we investigate the complexity of Target Set Reconfiguration in restricted cases.
		On the hardness side, we prove that Target Set Reconfiguration is $\textsf{PSPACE}$-complete on bipartite planar graphs of degree $3$ or $4$ and of threshold $2$, bipartite $3$-regular graphs of threshold $1$ or $2$, and split graphs, which is in contrast to the fact that a special case called Vertex Cover Reconfiguration is in $\textsf{P}$ for the last graph class.
		On the positive side, we present a polynomial-time algorithm for Target Set Reconfiguration on graphs of maximum degree $2$ and trees.
		The latter result can be thought of as a generalization of that for Vertex Cover Reconfiguration.
